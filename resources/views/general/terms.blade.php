				<h4>Read Carefully</h4>
				<p>
				By using Facebookads.com.ng, you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions: 
				
				
				<h4>Site Membership:</h4> Users must be at least 18 years of age or older to participate on our website. Facebookads.com.ng is made available for personal use only. One user may only operate one account. Creation of more than one account is considered fraud and will result in account termination. Only one account per user is allowed. This includes accounts being operated from the same device, using the same internet connection or IP address and any other action which we determine suggests a breach of this rule. Accounts cannot be shared and payment information like bank details, etc., cannot be shared. Members using Proxy, VPN will also be banned. You must provide current and accurate information (correct name and correct contact) upon registration for our Service. By agreeing to our terms and using the site, you acknowledge that any breach of these terms will result in any accounts involved being banned automatically. Any account banned on the platform will result in any earnings and current balance on that account and any related accounts being forfeited. Termination of an account does not merit the creation of a new account. Any account banned will result in the person registering that account receiving a permanent ban from Facebookads with any future accounts created being automatically banned with any earnings and current balance forfeited. You are only permitted to complete an offer once. If you are using other sites similar to this and do the same offer there then this is considered fraud and will result in account termination. You are solely responsible for keeping your Facebookads account and password confidential. Members are solely responsible for the payment and reporting of any local taxes that may be due in relation to any monies or prizes earned whilst using our Service.
				Account Termination: We reserve the right to refuse membership without giving a specific reason. Further, we reserve the right to terminate your account and close your account without notice at any time. 
				
				<h4>Account Verification:</h4> We reserve the right to ask members for an address confirmation document at any time to confirm that a valid account has been registered. This can be done as part of account spot checks or where we feel it is required to help reduce the risk of fraudulent activity on our site. Payment will be held until the member is fully verified or indefinitely if no address confirmation document is provided. By accepting our terms and site policy you acknowledge this information may be requested at any time and that failure to provide it will result no payment being due until it is received and verified. If the information for name/address verification provided does not match what is registered and held on the account then you acknowledge that the account will be terminated with the loss of any balance on the account. All members are required to complete our automated telephone verification phone call before they can withdraw their cash or points rewards. Telephone verification only needs to be completed once. Telephone verification is required on your first withdrawal only.
				Marketplace Rules - No spamming. No personal attacks or harassment including but not restricted to attacks against someone’s race, religion, politics, sex, sexual orientation, etc. No acts of harassment of a violent or sexual nature. For security, please only use English in the Marketplace. No solicitation. Do not discuss other similar websites. Do not discuss or make assumptions on anyone else’s account or account status. Do not attempt to discover personal details regarding any of our members directly or indirectly. Treat everyone with respect. Any comments, opinions, products or services made in the Marketplace are those of person posting comments, and do not reflect the view or opinion of Facebookads.com.ng.
				Subscription: When you buy an ad publishing plan, it can only last for 30 days. After that, you are required to renew your subscription to continue to enjoy your percentile earnings.
				
				<h4>Payments:</h4> Payment to members are processed at most once a week. Payments can be held for up to 60 days if fraud is suspected. If necessary, payments may require additional time in order to be processed. You, the member, understand and acknowledge that no payment shall be made to you or any other member until Facebookads has received payment from its advertisers. Prior to payment, each account will be audited in order to insure that no fraud has taken place. Facebookads.com.ng will never be deemed as owing payment to any member, but will make payments only after verification of the legitimacy of an account and balance. We will cancel payments after 7 days to any bank account which has not registered, that is, you provide us with an e-mail, but do not have an account. Additionally, we may remove payments or amounts from account balances if we deem it necessary. Any member found to be cheating our advertiser offers will be banned indefinitely, resulting in the forfeiture of all earnings. Any member found to be cheating our referral system or referral contests by providing fake referrals simply to win a contest or receive a bonus will also be banned indefinitely, resulting in the forfeiture of all earnings.
				
				<h4>Dormant Accounts:</h4> In order to minimize our administration overhead, we reserve the right to terminate dormant accounts. In order to keep an account active, we do require you to complete offers at least once every 2 months (60 days) 
				Duration of Membership: A publisher remains a full-fledged publisher if he continues to buy ads at the end of his subscription, which is approximately one month. Should he decide not to subscribe again, there would be no ads on his dashboard and his account is shut down after two months of inactivity.
				
				<h4>SPAM & Unsolicited Emails:</h4> We operate a strict ANTI-SPAM policy. Any member found to be sending unsolicited emails (SPAM) to other members, Marketplace and/or website will be banned from our site and all funds generated by that member will be confiscated. We do not promote or condone this behaviour and we encourage all members to adhere to our rules. Sending unsolicited emails is illegal. As a member of Facebookads.com.ng, you are strictly prohibited from promoting our website and/or your referral link through unsolicited emailing (SPAM) or any other form of social media and communication.
